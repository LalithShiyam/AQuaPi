# AQuaPi

AQuaPi: Absolute Quantification Pipeline, is a MATLAB based fully-automated computational framework, for non-invasively measuring cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using the synergistic data from a fully-integrated PET/MR.The framework comprises of an image-derived input function component and a quantification component, that work together to produce cerebral metabolic rates of glucose maps.

# Abilities

- Petrous segmentation from a 3D time-of-flight MR angiography
- MR driven motion correction (motion navigators needed): alignment of attenuation maps possible.
- Iterative partial volume correction aware of spatiotemporal variations of the target and background activities
- Voxelwise Patlak analysis
- Spatial normalisation (SPM12 DARTEL)
- Z-score calculation

# Requirements

- MATLAB version > or = R2016a 
- SPM 12 
- Siemens Biograph mMR and e7 reconstruction tools
  - 3D time-of-flight MR angiography sequence
  - 60-min PET list-mode acquisition
  - 3D MPRAGE T1 MR sequence
  - 3D EPI MR navigators  
  - Attenuation map: preferrably CT or pseudo-CT
