# AQuaPi Toolbox

AQuaPi: Absolute Quantification Pipeline, is a MATLAB based computational toolbox, for non-invasively measuring cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using the synergistic data from a fully-integrated PET/MR.The framework comprises of an image-derived input function component and a quantification component, that work together to produce cerebral metabolic rates of glucose maps.

# Abilities

- Petrous/cervical segmentation from a 3D time-of-flight MR angiography dataset
- MR driven motion compensation (motion navigators needed): alignment of attenuation maps possible.
- Iterative regional partial volume correction aware of the activity variations of the target and background.
- Voxelwise Patlak analysis
- Spatial normalisation (SPM12 DARTEL)
- Z-score calculation

# Requirements

- Software requirements
  - MATLAB version > or = R2016a 
  - SPM 12 
  - Siemens e7 reconstruction tools + JS-recon
  - Powershell ISE > 4.0
- Input data: Refer to the individual pages for the suggested settings and corresponding limitations
  - 3D time-of-flight MR angiography
  - 60-min PET list-mode acquisition
  - 3D MPRAGE T1 MR sequence
  - 3D EPI MR navigators
  - Attenuation map: preferrably CT or pseudo-CT
