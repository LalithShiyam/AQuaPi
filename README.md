# AQuaPi

AQuaPi: Absolute Quantification Pipeline, is a fully-automated computational framework, for non-invasively measuring cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using the synergistic data from a fully-integrated PET/MR.

Abilities:

- Petrous segmentation from a 3D time-of-flight MR angiography
- MR driven motion correction (motion navigators needed): alignment of attenuation maps possible.
- Spatiotemporal aware iterative partial volume correction
- Voxelwise Patlak analysis
- Spatial normalisation (SPM12 DARTEL)
- Z-score calculation
