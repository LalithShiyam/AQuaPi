# AQuaPi Toolbox

AQuaPi: Absolute Quantification Pipeline, is a MATLAB based computational toolbox, for non-invasively measuring cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using the synergistic data from a fully-integrated PET/MR.The framework comprises of an image-derived input function component and a quantification component, that work together to produce cerebral metabolic rates of glucose maps.

# Installation

# Usage

  ### Automated petrous/cervical segmentation
  #### Overview
  The segmentation algorithm has the ability to segment both the petrous and cervical region of the internal carotid arteries from the 3D time-of-flight MR angiography images in one go. 
  #### Hard-requirements
  - The field-of-view should include both petrous and cervical portion of the internal carotid arteries (refer the field-of-view shown below). 
  - Patient position should be head first supine (HFS orientation)
  #### Recommended field-of-view
  ![	3D-TOF-MRA-FOV](Images/3D-TOF-MRA-FOV.png)
  #### Tips
  1. Acquisition plane must be perpendicular to the blood flow in the internal carotid arteries. This ensures maximum contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissues.
  2. The imaging field-of-view should be larger than the imaging object. This would prevent wrap-around artifacts like the nose protruding through the back of the head.

  #### The code breaks
  1. When there is a significant Signal drop in the blood vessels.
  2. When there are severe wrap-around artifacts.

  ### Converting low-dose CT to CT-AC map
  #### Overview
  This function enables the conversion of low dose CT images to PET/MR compatible CT attenuation maps You can also use this program to strip off the pixel data from the dicom header if you use the last section :)
  #### Hard-requirements
  - Should be Siemens low-dose CT, however, this can be tweaked with a bit of effort.
  - Patient position should be head first supine (HFS orientation)
  - Dixon series is a hard-requirement.
  #### The code breaks
  Till now - never, fingers crossed!
